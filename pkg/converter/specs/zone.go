// ZoneID ...
type ZoneID int64

// Zone is composed from list of bodies.
// Every Zone have Base  Zone 3D model is created by using an pseudo algorithm:
// 	currentResult := zone.Base
// 	for _, construction := range(zone.Construction) {
//		currentResult = construction.Type(currentResult, construction.Body)
//	}
// Operations order is determined by Constructions array order.
//
// Eg: Base{cuboid}, Construction[{sphere, union}] is zone made from union of cuboid and sphere.
//
// Eg:Â Base{sphere}. Construction{{sphere, union}, {cuboid, intersect}] is zone made from
// intersection of cuboid and union of 2 spheres.
//
// Zones are structured as forest of B-trees.
// Parent <-> Children relationship means that children is contained entirely in parent.
// Zone is a tree root, if ID == RootID.
//
// TODO: intersections other than children <-> one parent like beetween childrens of same parent
// are not allowed.
